                <p>Welcome to my personal website!</p>


                <div class="personal-info">
                    <p>Hey there, I'm Angela, a BSIT student navigating the world with a smile as genuine as my love for anime and fantasy. You'll often catch me deep into the coding realm, embracing the challenges of technology with enthusiasm and a warm heart.

                        When I'm not immersed in the world of algorithms and codes, my true passion takes flight in anime and fantasy. Imagine me flipping through the pages of magical novels or binge-watching captivating anime series – that's where you'll find me in my element.
                        
                        Family is everything to me, and the ties that bind us are cherished. I take pride in being a good person, spreading kindness to those around me. Every chapter of my life is colored with the love and support of my family, and that's something truly special.
                        
                        Now, let me share a bit about Dale. He's not just a person; he's someone who adds an extra layer of joy to my life. Whether we're sharing stories, supporting each other's dreams, or just enjoying quiet moments together, our connection is a beautiful part of who I am.
                        
                        In this complex and fast-paced world, I stay grounded in my simplicity. Authenticity, kindness, and a love for both tech and fantasy define me. Join me on this journey as a BSIT student, anime and fantasy enthusiast, and a person devoted to family and love. It's a tapestry of warmth and genuine connection.
                        
                        And hey, if you're curious, you can check out my gallery to catch a glimpse of the things that inspire and bring joy to my world. Thanks for getting to know me! xoxo
